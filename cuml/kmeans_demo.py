K-Means Demo
KMeans is a basic but powerful clustering method which is optimized via Expectation Maximization. It randomly selects K data points in X, and computes which samples are close to these points. For every cluster of points, a mean is computed, and this becomes the new centroid.

cuMLâ€™s KMeans supports the scalable KMeans++ intialization method. This method is more stable than randomnly selecting K points.

The model can take array-like objects, either in host as NumPy arrays or in device (as Numba or cuda_array_interface-compliant), as well as cuDF DataFrames as the input.

For information about cuDF, refer to the cuDF documentation.
For additional information on cuML's k-means implementation: https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/api.html#cuml.KMeans.

Visualize Centroids
Scikit-learn's k-means implementation uses the k-means++ initialization strategy while cuML's k-means uses k-means||. 
As a result, the exact centroids found may not be exact as the std deviation of the points around the centroids in make_blobs is increased.

Note: Visualizing the centroids will only work when n_features = 2
